# Logistic-Regression---Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python

=> This project builds a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to predict heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure. The dataset contains 303 records with 14 features, and the model achieves 83.8% accuracy on the training data and 80.3% on the test data.

=> Project Workflow
1. Importing Libraries: Used libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
2. Data Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
3. Data Splitting: Split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets.
4. Model Training: Trained a Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluation: Measured accuracy on training and test data.
6. Prediction System: Built a system to predict heart disease based on input parameters.

=> Conslusion
This project demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be effectively used to predict heart disease based on key medical parameters. With an accuracy of 83.8% on training data and 80.3% on test data, the model provides reliable predictions. It can serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis, helping healthcare professionals take preventive actions.
